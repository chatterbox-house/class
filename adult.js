            title: "Death Penalty Debate",
            content: `⚖️ The death penalty, Japan's ultimate punishment, has been carried out in the country for the first time in two years and 11 months.
日本での究極の刑罰である死刑が、2年11カ月ぶりに執行されました。

🤔 It is essential to pause and thoroughly reconsider whether this system should be kept or abolished.
この制度を維持すべきか廃止すべきか、立ち止まって慎重に再考することが不可欠です。

👨‍⚖️ As long as humans judge other humans, miscarriages of justice can never be entirely prevented.
人が人を裁く限り、冤罪を完全に防ぐことはできません。
Do you believe any justice system can be 100% fair?
どんな司法制度でも100%公平になれると思いますか？
🧓 The case of Iwao Hakamada, 89, who was sentenced to death and later acquitted in a retrial, is a stark reminder of that reality.
死刑判決を受けた後、再審で無罪となった89歳の袴田巌さんの事件は、その現実を強く思い起こさせます。

🕰️ Hakamada was confined for nearly half a century, and the relentless fear of execution eroded his mental health.
袴田さんは約半世紀も拘束され、死刑への絶え間ない恐怖が精神状態を蝕みました。

🧾 In his retrial, the court acknowledged that investigative authorities had fabricated evidence against him.
再審では、捜査当局が証拠をねつ造していたことが裁判所によって認められました。
What should happen to authorities who fabricate evidence?
証拠をねつ造した当局に対して、どのような対応が取られるべきでしょうか？
🧑‍💼 In response to calls from the Japan Federation of Bar Associations, an expert panel to reconsider Japan's capital punishment system was established in 2024.
日本弁護士連合会の要請を受け、2024年に死刑制度を再検討するための有識者会議が設置されました。

📋 The panel, which includes lawmakers, former and present prosecutors and a former police chief, released a report concluding that the death penalty has "numerous issues that cannot remain ignored" and that the system "must not continue in its present form."
議員、元・現職の検察官、元警察署長らを含むこの会議は、「見過ごせない多くの問題がある」とし、「現行の形で制度を維持すべきではない」と結論付ける報告書を発表しました。

🏛️ The panel recommended setting up an official body under the Diet or a similar institution to fundamentally reexamine the death penalty system.
この会議は、国会などの機関の下に公式な組織を設置し、死刑制度を根本から再検討するよう提言しました。

Who should be responsible for reviewing and reforming legal systems?
法律制度の見直しや改革の責任は誰にあるべきだと思いますか？
🐢 Despite this recommendation, progress from the government remains slow.
この提言にもかかわらず、政府の対応は依然として遅れています。

📸 A 2022 scandal shook public confidence in the justice minister, who holds final authority on executions.
2022年のスキャンダルは、死刑執行に最終権限を持つ法務大臣への国民の信頼を揺るがしました。

🗣️ Then Justice Minister Yasuhiro Hanashi was dismissed following a comment that his position was a "low-key post that only makes a top story in daytime news programs when stamping a seal on documents in the morning for execution."
当時の法務大臣・葉梨康弘氏は、「朝に死刑執行の判に押すだけで昼のワイドショーに出る地味なポスト」と発言し、更迭されました。
Should public officials be removed for insensitive comments? Why or why not?
不適切な発言をした公職者は解任されるべきだと思いますか？その理由は？
📊 The government cites public opinion polls showing about 80% of respondents consider capital punishment "unavoidable" as justification for keeping the system in place.
政府は、約80％の国民が死刑を「やむを得ない」と考えているという世論調査を、制度維持の根拠としています。

🇫🇷 But in France, despite public opinion favoring the death penalty at the time, the government chose instead to prioritize human rights and abolished the system in 1981.
しかしフランスでは、当時世論が死刑支持であったにもかかわらず、人権を優先して1981年に死刑制度を廃止しました。

💬 About 60% of survey respondents in Japan supporting the death penalty listed consideration for the feelings of the victims' side as a key reason.
日本で死刑を支持する回答者の約60％が、被害者側の感情への配慮を主な理由として挙げています。
How should a justice system balance victims' feelings with human rights?
司法制度は、被害者の感情と人権のバランスをどのように取るべきだと思いますか？
🧠 While this is a perspective that must not be forgotten, it must also be recognized that the viewpoints of bereaved families vary from person to person and can change over time.
この視点は忘れてはならないものの、遺族の意見は人によって異なり、時間とともに変化することも認識すべきです。

🕵️‍♂️ Adequate information disclosure is indispensable when debating whether the system should be kept or not.
制度を維持するか否かを議論する上で、適切な情報開示は不可欠です。

🙊 Yet, Japan remains reluctant to fully disclose relevant details.
しかし、日本は依然として関連情報の完全な開示に消極的です。
Should governments be required to fully disclose information about executions?
政府は死刑に関する情報を全面的に公開すべきだと思いますか？
🔍 In the latest execution as well, the government revealed only the executed individual's name and an overview of the case.
最新の執行においても、政府は死刑執行者の名前と事件の概要のみを公表しました。

🕰️ Not even the timing of the individual being informed about the execution was aired.
死刑囚にいつ執行を告げたのかさえ、公表されていませんでした。

🚫 Informing death row inmates of their impending execution immediately beforehand has drawn criticism as a violation of human rights.
死刑囚に執行直前に告げるという慣行は、人権侵害として批判されています。

🌱 Life is the foundation of human rights.
命は人権の根幹です。

🗺️ The principle that even a state has no right to infringe upon this right has become increasingly widespread.
国家でさえこの権利を侵してはならないという原則は、ますます広く認識されるようになっています。

🛑 In fact, some countries retain the death penalty system itself but have suspended executions.
実際、死刑制度を維持しつつも、執行を停止している国もあります。

❌ Once a death penalty has been carried out, it is irreversible.
一度死刑が執行されれば、それは取り返しがつきません。

🗣️ Japan should engage in deeper discussions, envisioning the eventual abolition of capital punishment.
日本は、死刑制度の将来的な廃止を視野に入れた、より深い議論を行うべきです。

Do you think Japan should abolish the death penalty? Why or why not?
日本は死刑を廃止すべきだと思いますか？その理由は？`
